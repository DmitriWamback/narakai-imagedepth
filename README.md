# Narakai Image Depth

<p>Visualizing depth maps generated from MiDaS and AI from a 2D image (using pytorch)</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to allow people to insert 3D objects in the background of your image and possibly for multiple distance effects</p>
<p>This program is built from OpenTK (C# equivalent for OpenGL) for adding custom effect using shaders</p>
